# What is it?

FlueFlame is an open-source framework for creating End-To-End tests. FlueFlame was developed for testing ASP.NET Core applications, but can be used to test any backend.

It is implemented in the Fluent API style, which allows you to write understandable declarative tests. FlueFlame also has packages that allow you to test not only REST APIs, but also technologies such as gRPC and SignalR.
